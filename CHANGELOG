AURBUILD
 -v1.8.2 (March 3, 2008)
	* Fancy new search output
	* Fixed bug that prevented --sync from working properly
	  Package repo database wasn't being found. (moved in pacman 3.1.0)
	* Disabled --vote and --unvote again
	* Moved a bunch of functions out of the main script
 	* Fix bug that makes builddeps fail if the package has been previously
	  built by aurbuild
	* Got rid of annoying pkgname.pid dirs in /var/tmp/aurbuild/build
	  Now it's just /var/tmp/aurbuild/build/pkgname and it gets
	  overwritten if you try to build via aurbuild again. 
	* Remove makepkgv2 support
	* Remove all uses of versionpkg. (makepkg has assimilated its function)
	* --revision removed. It's made obsolete by makepkg
	* Added BUGS file to help keep track of bugs

 -v1.8.1 (February 29, 2008)
	* Fixed a lot of stuff in README and the man page
	* Restored --auto-build and --upgrade
	* --upgrade output shows versions and alerts to non-AUR foreign
	  packages.

 -v1.8.0 (February 21, 2008)
	* Updates to make aurbuild compatible with AUR 1.5.0
	* Cleaned up directory structure
	* Tweaked setup script, and some other files (more to come)
	* Added aurbuild's own PKGBUILD to misc/
	* Removed safe flagging notices and checks.
	  (Removed from AUR web interface)
	* Temporarily removed --vote --unvote --upgrade and --auto-build

 -v1.7.8 (March 29, 2007)
	* USE_FAKEROOT fix due to makepkg v3
	* USE_COLOR fix due to makepkg v3
	* lost PKGDEST due to makepkg v3

 -v1.7.7 (March 24, 2007)
	* Fixed lost permissions in AUR tarball.

 -v1.7.6 (March 3, 2007)
	* Fixed failed C compliler checks during .configure due to an
	  unwritable HOME location for ccache. HOME will be passed as
	  /var/tmp/aurbuild and thus ccache data will reside in
	  /var/tmp/aurbuild/.ccache for aurbuilds.

 -v1.7.5 (February 26, 2007)
	* Fixed broken Maintainer field in --search due to AUR upgrade.
	* Spelling corrections in manual page.

 -v1.7.4 (February 10, 2007)
 	* Fixed permission errors while extracting the AUR tarball.
	* Corrected message about needing write AND EXECUTE permissions on the
	  $PKGDEST in main script and man page.
	* Added -f, --official to build official packages found in /var/abs/.
	* Added [community] package support by calling on aurbuild --official
	  as needed (see COMMUNITY PACKAGES in man page for more details).

 -v1.7.3 (January 22, 2007)
	* Spelling correction for versionpkg().

 -v1.7.2 (January 21, 2007)
 	* Fixed missing -f option to versionpkg.
	* Fixed makepkg v3 missing -w option.
	* Added --rm-make-deps to remove unneeded make dependencies after a
	  successful build.

 -v1.7.1 (January 17, 2007)
 	* fixed extraction errors
	* help menu fix
	* /usr/share/doc files included in setup.py

 -v1.7 (January 16, 2007)
 	* Running as regular user is no longer needed. Root access will be
	  required to drop down to a designated under-privileged 
	  user for building. This will enable greater future scalability while
	  adding a higher level of security to the build process.
	* build directory location now in
	  /var/tmp/aurbuild/build/<pkgname>.<pid>
	* PKGBUILD save location now in /var/tmp/aurbuild/pkgbuilds/<pkgname>
	* sudo/su -c are no longer needed.
	* options --wait-sudo, --no-sudo removed.
	* option --keep-build-dir removed. Failed builds are retained by
	  default now.
	* option -c, --clean added to clean the build directory (for failed
	  builds).
	* source files are copied into /var/cache/pacman/src to prevent
	  unnecessary multiple downloads.
	* Makepkg v2 and v3 compatibility.
 	* Man page spelling correction.

 -v1.6.1.1 (November 21, 2006)
 	* Fixed failed logins with --vote and --unvote due to non-English
	  language settings in the AUR account.

 -v1.6.1 (November 17, 2006)
 	* Extended package search with build operations. If package is not
	  found in AUR, repeat search with an appended space. 
	  This finds "lost" packages for those with short names, ie. rar, not
	  descriptive enough to be found in standard search queries.
	* Fixed duplicate package build directories within the master build
	  directory.

 -v1.6 (November 5, 2006)
 	* Replaced makepkg-opts with builder-opts. This passes OPTS to the
	  builder of choice (makepkg or versionpkg) selected from the menu.
	  Note the syntax has changed:
	  --makepkg-opts="ab bla foo" -->  --builder-opts="-a -b --bla --foo"
	* sudo is no longer a required dependency. su -c "CMD" will be invoked
	  if sudo is not installed, requiring a root password.
	* -t, --no-sudo switch added to disable the use of sudo and use
	  su -c "CMD" for root operations.
	* -r, --revision switch added to check SVN/CVS/MERCURIAL servers for
	  the latest revisions on qualified PKGBUILDS during an --upgrade
	  session.
	* Absolute environmental editor path and switches supported.
	* Preferred builder auto detection implemented. Variables in the
	  PKGBUILD are examined and a star is placed next to the preferred
	  builder as well as being pre-selected in the choice field.

 -v1.5.2 (September 28, 2006)
	* Fixed 'Index out of range' errors when running --upgrade due to
	  corrupt database files.
	* Removed redundant 'Category:' field in --search. Should be displayed
	  in 'Location:'.

 -v1.5.1 (August 8, 2006)
	* Fixed inhereted setgid bit in the built the package resulting from
	  AUR's set mode of the parent directory in the tarball.
	  The unwanted inhereted bit occured only under the following
	  circumstances:
		- user was root.
		- a 'install -m<MODE NUMBER>' line was excuted in the PKGBUILD
		  without explicitly setting the first pair of octets, 
		  ie 644 instead of 0644
		- Any other type of 'chmod' command without the first octet set.

	  If you have built any packages meeting the criteria list above,
	  rebuild and install offending packages now. Run the update command to
	  get the list of all packages built from AUR. String them together in
	  a space separated line to aurbuild and use the menu to see if any
	  install/chmod lines were used. You can use (s) from the menu to skip
	  the current package and move on to the next.

 -v1.5 (July 26, 2006)
	* Added -w, --wait-sudo to wait for the user to hit enter before using
	  sudo.
	* Added -k, --keep-build-dir to keep the build directory if a package
	  fails to build.
	* Added versionpkg to the menu for CVS/SVN/Mercurial packages.
	* Fixed 'aur[1]' traceback calls when using --upgrade due to PKGBUILD's
	  with syntax errors on the AUR server.

          The default action is to skip the package and relay the package name
	  and syntax errors back to the user.
	* version.py: alpha-numeric recombination logic re-worked. A rare few
	  may find new upgrades.

 -v1.4 (July 15, 2006)
	* Added -V, --vote and -U, --unvote switches to vote or un-vote for
	  packages.
	* Support for multiple running instances by using unique build
	  directories, ~/.aurbuild.<PID>
	* Manpage typos corrected.
	* More module refactoring for a (hopefully) smoother and quicker
	  upgrade process to pacman3 and further AUR updates.

 -v1.3.1 (July 1, 2006)
	* --local and --save swtich are supported in conjunction with --upgrade.
	* Switch handling refactored.
	* Data is piped to less program instead of creating, writing, and
	  reading temp files with --search.
	* Dependency tree display improvements.
	* Speed improvement to find.py.
	* Dependencies order fix.

 -v1.3 (June 11, 2006)
	* Detailed dependency tree readout indicating missing dependencies
	  marked `[D]' and make dependencies marked `[M]'.
	* Confirmation message for target dependencies.
	* Sudo is not used when user is root, nor is it or fakeroot required
	  for root operations.
	* Tempfile is used to create and manage temporary file for --search
	  switch.
	* Option parsing uses getopt instead of optparse for quicker parsing
	  and greater flexibility and control.
	* Some code refactoring.
	* "global name `pkgurl' is not defined" bug fixed in an AUR retrieval
	  exception.

 -v1.2.3 (May 6, 2006)
	* An unforeseen problem involving the direct url implemntation and left
	  over community tarballs has forced a rollback to the old parse-method.
	* websearch.py module behaves more like a module should by returning
	  lists.
	* --search switch will print results to screen if the `less' program is
	  not installed.
	* EDITOR value verified for existance on machine before proceeding.

 -v1.2.2 (April 25, 2006)
	* Retrieves tarball using /$pkgname/$pkgname.tar.gz instead of parsing
	  web pages. This will be faster and pick up more packages than before.

 -v1.2.1 (March 20, 2006)
	* Fixed the unneeded installation of dependencies by examining
	  'provides' info in the database.

 -v1.2 (March 7, 2006)
	* Added -e, --save to save the build files from extracted tarball into
	  ~/.aursave
	* Added -l, --local to look localy in ~/.aursave for the build files
	  instead of AUR.

 -v1.1 (March 1, 2006)
	* Changed confirmation messages to accept ENTER as yes.
	* Added -o, --makepkg-opts=OPTS to pass options to makepkg during build.

 -v1.0.2 (February 10, 2006)
	* Made nano as the default editor if EDITOR environmental variable is
	  not found.
	* Fixed that damn "requires x-server" dependency call that always slips
	  my nose.

 -v1.0.1 (January 24, 2006)
	* Added --noinstall to omit the installation per request.

 -v1.0 (January 20, 2006)
	* Some finishing touches for 1.0 release.

 -v0.9.3 (January 14, 2006)
	* More improvements to --upgrade switch.
	* Added "skip this package" feature to the menu.
	* AUR syntax update for packages marked "orphan" on --search switch.

 -v0.9.2 (January 4, 2006)
	* Several bug fixes and minor improvements. --upgrade should cause no
	  trouble now.
	* Uses a python find module instead of opening up the system. Results
	  should be more accurate.
	* makepkg will no longer be invoked with sudo to build the dependancies
	  from abs. Instead, relevant build files from the dependencies are
	  copied into aurbuild's work directory in home and built as normal
	  user.

 -v0.9.1 (December 29, 2005)
	* Fixed upgrade bug involving letters in the version string.
	* If package is not safe and a .install file is included, you are
	  forced to view it.

 -v0.9 (December 28, 2005)
	* Added --upgrade switch to update aur packages.
	* Added --noconfirm switch to bypass confirmation messages with
	  --upgrade.

 -v0.8.1 (December 18, 2005)
	* Included man page.
	* Changed source URL.

 -v0.8 (December 16, 2005)
	* Refactored code.
	* Improved dependency read-out.
	* Replaced os.spawn, os.system, etc. with up-to-date subprocess.Popen.
	* Checks for needed system programs.
	* Handles *.bz2 tarballs.

	* Removed the config file to use the EDITOR environment variable
	  instead.
	* Added --auto-build or -a as a modifier to --builddeps and --syncdeps. 
	  This will bypass the menu and build the package if it is detected
	  safe.

 -v0.7 (December 4, 2005)
	* Added config file for the editor and replaced menu entries with
	  tarball files for editing.


 -v0.6.1 (December 3, 2005)
	* Replaced zile with emacs in the menu as per request.

 -v0.6 (December 3, 2005)
	* Rewritten in python for ease of maintainance.

 -v0.5.2 (October 15, 2005)
	* Control+C will safely exit and cleanup work files.
	* Uses a temporary directory in $HOME to build packages instead of
	  tmpfs.
	  This should eliminate failed builds due to large packages
	  over-filling tmpfs.

 -v0.5.1 (September 23, 2005)
	* Fixed empty search fields beginning with digits.
	* Minor improvemnts to search function.
 
 -v0.5 (September 18, 2005)

	  package as user.

 -v0.2 (August 14, 2005)
	* Uploaded to server.
