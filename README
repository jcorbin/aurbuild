aurbuild is a utility to build and install packages from the Arch Linux
User Community Repositories through the use of makepkg and pacman.

Root access is required but will be temporarily dropped to an under
privileged user during builds for safety and package integrity.
Read the man page aurbuild(1) for more details on this tool.

BE CAREFUL when adjusting build files as they could potentially harm your
system if not done properly!

Requirements
------------
python, pacman 3.1.0 or later, makepkg (found in pacman) and fakeroot
abs is required if you want to build official packages.

Installation
------------
On Arch Linux:
	$ cd misc/
	$ makepkg
	$ sudo pacman -U aurbuild-VERSION.tar.gz
